# Getting started
IpEngine's API exposes the entire IpEngine infrastructure via a standardized programmatic interface. Using IpEngine's API, you can do just about anything you can do on ipengine.com via the customer dashboard.

IpEngine spans a broad range of products that help you build incredible communications experiences, and security apply to everything you want to build.

These docs will help you interact with the API, help you set up your development environment to build apps with IpEngine, use your trial account to test your work.

## What is IpEngine?
IpEngine provides details on IP address, protects them from attacks, ensures they are always online. Every month, more than 1.8 billion people experience a faster, safer, better Internet thanks to IpEngine.

## What's a API, anyway?
An API is an application programming interface - in short, it's a set of rules that lets programs talk to each other, exposing data and functionality across the internet in a consistent format.

## How to check a custom ip?
You can check an custom ip using this format `https://api.ipengine.dev/ip/{ip}`
